1 16oz Box of Elbow Macaroni,use 1/2 box 
2 Celery stalks- thinly sliced
1/2 Medium Yellow onion- diced,
1/2 Med Carrot- peeled and shredded
Green olives, as many to you liking, they can make your dish salty
try 12 cut in half, may remove some of the pimentos if you want,  I do 
2-3 Hard boiled eggs
S/P to your taste
1/2tsp- Italian season
Dash of Celery Salt, if you have it

Dressing:
1-Cup Mayonaise
Firm squeeze of Yellow Mustard
1T Pickle juice
Splash of Milk

Directons:

Cook pasta in a pot of boiling water, I also add the eggs to the pot while its cooking till Aldente, drain, set aside
Chop all the veggies, olives set aside
When pasta cools down, Add in a large bowl and add the veggies, olives, spices
In a seperate bowl make the dressing, whisk all the ingredients carefully, if its to thick you can add a splash of more milk
When Mac and Salad is mixed together, fold in the chopped egg.
If the Mac salad seems like it doesn't have enough dressing, make another small batch.  Make it to your taste and liking
ENJOY :)
